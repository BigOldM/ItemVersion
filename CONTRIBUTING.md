# Contributing

- Beginners are welcome. If you are new to programming, Git, Lua, or anything related to the
  project, then I can help you. Just ask.
- No contribution is too small! Please submit as many fixes for typos and grammar bloopers as you
  can.
- Don't be afraid to open half-finished PRs, and ask questions if something is unclear!
- Pull requests should be made on their own separate branches.
- Try to limit each pull request to _one_ idea only.
- Please document how you tested your changes in your pull request.
- Make sure your changes pass the status checks.
- If you would like, please add your name to the
  [`AUTHORS.md`](https://github.com/t-mart/ItemVersion/blob/master/AUTHORS.md) file. Pseudonyms are
  fine.
- This addon uses [StyLua] for Lua code formatting. See its documentation for how to apply it to
  your contributions.

## Developer Environment

ItemVersion uses [`wap`](https://t-mart.github.io/wap/) for most development tasks. See [wap for
Collaborators](https://t-mart.github.io/wap/wap-for-collaborators/) to get started. Using `wap` will
give you a nice developer experience that automatically rebuilds on file changes and links
ItemVersion into your `Interface/AddOns` directory.

In particular, if you do not use `wap` to build the addon, you won't be able to use it in the game.
This is because `wap` transforms the source files here into a usable addon.

_(If you really don't want to use `wap`, you can just download the built addon artifact that is
created after each pull request by the `Build` workflow. But, you'll only be able to access it
after a one-time grant by me, and further, only after you push. If you need `wap` help, just ask
me.)_

## Versioning

ItemVersion adheres to [CalVer](https://calver.org/) for its releases.

This is the format: `year.weeknumber.patch`.

Data refresh releases will bump the `year.weeknumber` part. Intraweek development releases will bump
the `patch` part.

## Release Process

See the [`Release`](https://github.com/t-mart/ItemVersion/blob/master/.github/workflows/release.yml)
GitHub Action for details.

Releases happen in the following circumstances:

- Automatically every week on Tuesday, in which the item database will be refreshed.
- Manually, whenever a reasonable amount of development work warrants one.
